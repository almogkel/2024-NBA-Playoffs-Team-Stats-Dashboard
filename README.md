# 2024-NBA-Playoffs-Team-Stats-Dashboard

This project visualizes key team and player statistics from the 2024 NBA Playoffs. It was created using Tableau Public and includes insights such as:
- **Team Stats Per Game**: Points, rebounds, assists, and more.
- **Top Players**: Performance distribution for the top players in selected stats(Points,Assists,Rebounds,steals etc).
- **Shooting Efficiency**: FG% vs. FGA scatter plot for players.
- **Bench vs. Starters**: Comparison of selected stats scored by starters vs. the bench.

The primary objective of this project was to analyze team and player performance in the 2024 NBA Playoffs using real-world data. The key focus was to visualize important metrics in a clear and interactive way, allowing for easy comparisons between teams and players.

This project allowed me to apply my skills in:
- **Data analysis and manipulation** in Excel.
- **Data visualization** using Tableau Public.
- **Sports statistics** analysis.

## Dashboard Features
- **Team Selection**: Select one team that participated in the playoffs.
- **Stat Selection**: Choose one statistic (Points, Assists, Rebounds, Steals, etc) to analyze.
- **Team Playoff Summary**: Displays a quick summary of team performance through different playoff rounds. 
- **Shooting Efficiency**: A scatter plot showing FG% vs. FGA for individual players from the same team. Players above the average line indicate strong shooting performance.
- **Team Stats Per Game**: A bar chart comparing key metrics such as Points, Rebounds, Assists, and Turnovers for the selected team.
- **Top Players in the Team**: Highlights the top performers on the selected team, comparing their selected stat per game.
- **Position Performance Distribution**: A pie chart showcasing the distribution of selected stat across different positions (C, PF, SF, etc.).
- **Bench vs. Starters Performance**: Compares selected stat by the starting lineup versus the bench players, providing insights into team depth.

## Technical Details

- **Data Source**: The statistics were sourced from [publicly available NBA statistics for the 2024 playoffs.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2024_per_game.html)
- **Tools Used**:
  - **Tableau Public** for visualization.
  - **Excel** for initial data storage and preparation.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data visualization and sports analysis. I was able to translate raw data into an interactive and informative dashboard that highlights team and player performance during the 2024 NBA Playoffs. This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, create dynamic visualizations, and derive insights from the data.

As a recent graduate in Industrial Engineering and Management, specializing in Data Science, I am excited to apply these skills in a professional setting. I am eager to bring my analytical and creative problem-solving skills to an entry-level data analyst role in the sports industry.
